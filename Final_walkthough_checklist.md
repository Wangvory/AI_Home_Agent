# Final Walkthrough Checklist – 3760 Hoover St (Jan 23)

Use this checklist during your final walkthrough to verify repairs are complete and confirm the property condition matches what you agreed to.

---

## Quick Setup (Do this first)
- [ ] Bring: flashlight, phone charger, small towel/paper towels, marble/ball, post-it notes, blue tape marker
- [ ] Confirm utilities ON: water + gas + electric (so you can test everything)
- [ ] Take a slow video walking the whole house (one shot per room) to document “as-is condition”

---

## Seller Obligations & Repairs
- [ ] Verify all agreed repairs completed + obtain contractor receipts/invoices
- [ ] Confirm repair quality (no temporary patches / cover-ups)
- [ ] Photograph/record all repaired areas + any issues found

---

## Crawlspace & Foundation (Highest Risk)
- [ ] **Leaning/Tilted Support Pier(s)/Post(s)** – verify post is plumb and properly supported
- [ ] **Moisture/Efflorescence** – check perimeter + crawlspace smell; confirm no new moisture/pooling
- [ ] **Limited Crawlspace Access Areas** (living room, hall bath, kitchen, dining) – check inside for:
  - [ ] cracks (walls/ceilings)
  - [ ] sticking doors
  - [ ] uneven/bouncy floors
- [ ] **Damaged Subfloor Under Primary Bath** – see Bathroom section for stress test

---

## Roof / Gutters / Downspouts / Drainage
- [ ] Visually scan roof from yard for: missing shingles, lifted edges, uneven/sagging roofline
- [ ] Gutters firmly attached (no sagging or separation)
- [ ] Downspouts connected + discharge away from foundation (extensions connected)
- [ ] Walk exterior perimeter: confirm grading slopes away; no pooling near foundation
- [ ] Patio/slab near house: check cracks, heaving, and water pooling after rain

---

## Attic & Insulation
- [ ] **Attic Storage Safety** – remove heavy/excess storage; confirm no framing strain
- [ ] **Moisture Stains / Wetness**
  - [ ] Look for active wetness (not just old stains)
  - [ ] Smell test: musty odor = ventilation/moisture
  - [ ] Check around penetrations: chimney/flashing/vents/skylights
- [ ] Ventilation & exhaust routing
  - [ ] Bathroom fans vent to exterior (not into attic)
  - [ ] No blocked vents
- [ ] Insulation condition
  - [ ] Insulation not wet/matted
  - [ ] No big gaps/low coverage areas
- [ ] Pests (report flagged)
  - [ ] Signs of mice: droppings, nests, chewed wires, insulation tunnels

---

## HVAC + Airflow
- [ ] Turn HEAT on for 5 mins → warm air from multiple vents
- [ ] Turn COOL on for 5 mins (if possible) → cold air from vents
- [ ] Thermostat responds correctly
- [ ] Listen for abnormal sounds: rattling/whining
- [ ] Check air filter condition
- [ ] Walk room-to-room: any rooms with weak airflow?

---

## Plumbing & Water (Includes Stress Test)
### Whole-house water load test
- [ ] Run shower + sink + flush toilet at same time
- [ ] Check: pressure drop, slow drains, gurgling (venting/drain line issue)

### Bathroom stress test (especially primary bath)

### Exterior hose bibs
- [ ] Turn on full blast; check leaks + pressure

---

## Electrical & Safety
- [ ] Test outlets (at least 2 per room) using charger
